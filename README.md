This is my board game that I am developing. The project started as a way to quickly draft and test ideas for the game, but it quickly turned into an interesting project, to create the UI, multiplayer, and so on.
To play this, you just need to download the repo and install pygame. I will be making this into an executable and publishing it eventually.
